Manual installation Once you have the private download link from your sales team, you can manually install it into an existing Python environment using. $ pip install https://private-url/dominocode.tar.gz ---> 100% From a notebook You can also run this from your notebook, by running !pip install ... from a code cell. Not persistent If you install this into a running workspace, you might lose the installed package when the workspace restarts. It is best practice to install it as explained in the next section. Install for workspace When a workspace is created, a requirements.txt file will be used to install Python packages into your new environment. We can use this to make sure dominocode is installed before we start our notebook. Navigate to Files In your project, navigate to Files . Create a new file Create a new file by clicking the left most icon to get to the following screen Give filename and enter url Enter the requirements.txt filename in the top textfield and the private url in the bottom textarea.
